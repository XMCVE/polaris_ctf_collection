## **Alice's warm up**

“Welcome to the XCTF-*CTF2022, I’m Alice and interested in AI security. I prepared a easy warm-up for you before you enjoy those pure AI security challenges.
Like humans, AI also needs to warm up before running. Can you find something strange in these initialized parameters?”

## **Alice's challenge**

Alice and Bob decided to train a better AI model with their own data sets. However, Bob doesn’t want to show Alice all his secrets, especially his original pictures, so he only gave Alice some training gradients. But is it really safe?

You can build the environment locally through the attachment docker-compose.yml file. And you can get a isolated container that lasts for 3 minutes by providing the correct n, good luck!
