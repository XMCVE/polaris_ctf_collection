## `baby flaglab`

Score: *264*

Hope this challenge can bring back the flaglab pwning experience in Real World CTF 2018.

Note: For the remote envrionment, after proof-of-work, it may still take a few minutes to launch the flaglab website. If you can't access the web page, just be patient:-)

HINT: Baby flaglab is too immaturate to properly process images.
